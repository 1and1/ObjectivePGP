Implementation of RFC4880 (OpenPGP)

Working, but it's in early alpha stage.

Known issues:

1. Revocation is not fully supported
2. Embeded signatures - not supported
3. ZIP compression not supported
5. Old encrypted packets - mostly not supported
6. Only RSA cipher is fully supported
7. Defaults hardcoded

Need to rewrite whole thing!
