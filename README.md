Implementation of RFC4880 (OpenPGP)

Working, but it's in early alpha stage.

Known issues:

1. Revocation is not fully supported
2. Embedded signatures - not supported
3. ZIP compression not supported
5. Old encrypted packets - mostly not supported
6. Blowfish and Twofish are not supported
7.  No external configuration for defaults

Need to rewrite whole thing!
